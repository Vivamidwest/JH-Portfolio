        <div class="meta-info">
            <span>**Project Title:** The Autograph King (Documentary Film)</span>
            <span>**Role:** Film Editor, Co-Producer</span>
            <span>**Company/Client:** Independent Production / Scott Zakarin</span>
            <span>**Dates:** July 2024 - February 2025</span>
            <span>**Project Type:** Feature Documentary</span>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Project Overview & Context</h2>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> "The Autograph King" is a documentary centered on a high-functioning 31-year-old man with autism and cerebral palsy who finds joy and connects with others through attending comic book conventions.</p>
        <p><strong>Overall Contribution:</strong> I inherited this project after nine months of stalled editing, with only a 2.5-hour raw string-out completed and no interviews assembled. My role involved comprehensively assessing and restructuring the footage to create a compelling, character-driven narrative. Everything was done in Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
        <p><strong>View the Rough Cut Showreel:</strong> For a glimpse into the film's narrative and visual style, you can watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/DHJwr11GhWw?si=lpUO9-MCvuyW2vyW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rough Cut Showreel on YouTube</a>.</p>

        <h2>2. My Role</h2>
        <h3>Specific Responsibilities:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Systematically reviewed and meticulously dug through nearly a year's worth of unorganized raw footage to ascertain exactly what assets were available and salvageable.</li>
            <li>Efficiently "shaved the fat" from the initial 2.5-hour timeline, identifying key moments and removing extraneous material.</li>
            <li>Located and grouped clips sharing similar themes to construct a coherent story, effectively creating character development without a pre-existing script.</li>
            <li>Collaborated with the producer to craft a joyful and unique narrative, offering a fresh perspective often unseen in documentaries about individuals with disabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Process & Challenges</h2>
        <p><strong>Workflow Description:</strong> My process began with an intensive audit of disorganized footage, followed by thematic organization in Adobe Premiere Pro, timeline refinement, and a creative storytelling approach to shape the documentary's emotional and narrative arc.</p>
        <h3>Challenges Faced:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Challenge 1: Disorganized & Stalled Project (9 Months In):</strong> Inheriting a project with extensive raw footage that had been ineffectively edited for nine months, featuring only a 2.5-hour raw string-out and consolidated incomplete pieces, requiring deep dives to find raw source material.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Conducted a thorough forensic assessment of all available footage, meticulously re-linking and organizing assets within Premiere Pro to establish a stable and workable project foundation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Challenge 2: Lack of Script & Narrative Structure:</strong> The film had been shot for almost a year without a script, resulting in vast, unstructured footage that lacked a clear narrative direction.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Employed a thematic editing approach, identifying recurring themes, character moments, and emotional beats within the raw footage to organically build a compelling story with genuine character development.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Challenge 3: Producer Nervousness & Sensitivity:</strong> The producer was initially very apprehensive about screening the rough cut to the main character and his family, given the sensitive nature of the subject.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Focused on meticulously crafting a positive, respectful, and joyful narrative, emphasizing the main character's background, interests, and connections, which ultimately earned full support and positive feedback from the family.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Impact & Outcome</h2>
        <h3>Key Results:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Successfully transformed a stagnant project burdened by extensive unorganized footage into a cohesive, engaging, and joyful documentary narrative.</li>
            <li>Received overwhelmingly positive feedback and full support from the main character and his family, validating the sensitive and unique narrative approach.</li>
            <li>Crafted a film that aims to be a "breath of fresh air," offering an uplifting and connecting perspective that is unique within the documentary genre.</li>
            <li>The film is currently in the final stages of completion and is actively seeking a buyer, with strong potential for distribution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Overall Learning/Growth:</strong> This project significantly honed my skills in narrative leadership within unstructured environments, demonstrating a robust ability to problem-solve, uncover, and sculpt compelling stories from challenging raw material. It also enhanced my expertise in project recovery and sensitive, character-driven storytelling.</p>
